# RH-1080p-Project
Trying to make HQ textures

This project aims to collect all the Rhythm Heaven Fever and Rhythm Heaven Megamix textures, as well as their animation related files (BRCAD and BCCAD).

# Explanation on how stuff is organized

The project has two big folders, one for use in Rhythm Heaven Megamix and another one for Rhythm Heaven Fever.

The project is optimized for use with Citra


# I want to contribute! What's the process for upscaling textures?

1. Get the texture (use Spriter's Resource or direct extraction from the game)
2. Upscale the texture (use waifu2x)
3. Refine the texture with vectors (Adobe Illustrator is recommended)
4. Refine final details by hand

# I want to contribute! What's the process for obtaining animation-related files?

**Megamix:**

*Initial extraction*
W.I.P.

*BCCAD and .h extraction*
1. Download the "Kuriimu" toolkit.
2. Open up the .zlib with Karameru.
3. Extract all .bccad by clicking on them and clicking "Extract File" for each one. (You can alternatively use the "Export All" function.)
4. Place them in the desired folder.

**Fever:**

*Initial extraction*
1. Download the "Dolphin emulator" and obtain a copy of Rhythm Heaven Fever avaliable to use in it.
2. In Dolphin's list view, right click the game you want to extract the textures's from.
3. Click on "Properties"
4. Click on "Filesystem"
5. At this point, you can decide to extract the entire file system (right click "Partition 0" -> "Extract Files" -> Select a Folder) or continue until you find your desired file and extract when you get to it.
6. In the case of non-Japanese versions of RHF, navigate towards de desired version (EN, FR, GE, IT, SP, KR)
7. Navigate towards "content2" -> "cellanim"
8. Locate the game you want to extract.
9. Navigate to the desired "cellanim.szs". (Note that some games have different variations, all of them have a "cellanim.szs" for each texture).
10. At this point, if you haven't extracted files in step 4, extract your desired .szs .
11. Place the .szs in the desired folder.

*BRCAD and .h extraction*
1. Download "BrawlBox"
2. Open up the .szs with BrawlBox.
3. Extract all .brcad and .h by right clicking and clicking "Export" for each one. (The "Export All" function doesn't work for me)
4. Place them in the desired folder.
